--How make functions--
--Firstly we are going to create a basic function on a part--
local part = Instance.new("Part")
part.Parent = game:GetService("Workspace")
--Now we are going to make a function which if a player touches the part he will die--
function Kill(Part)

end
part.Touched:connect(Part)
--Here we have to add the code inside the function--
function Kill(Part)
if part.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid") ~= nil then-- we made an if statement to check if he has a Humanoid
part.Parent.Torso:BreakJoints()--Joints are Instances which keep the player attached to the torso--
end
end
part.Touched:connect(Part)
--And that should do--
